# Material-Point-Generator
This repository contains Python scripts that use Gmsh to generate material and surface points from STL files, to be used in a Material Point Method solver. Tetrahedral mesh centroids serve as material points with associated volumes, while surface triangles are used to create surface points with calculated normal vectors.
